Date: 2026-01-06
Status: COMPLETED

## Executive Summary
Rebuilt high-z galaxy catalog using ONLY verified data sources.
All contaminated data (66% of previous catalog) has been excluded.

## Verified Data Sources Used

| Source | N Input | N After Filters | Status |
|--------|---------|-----------------|--------|
| JADES DR2/DR3 photometry | 16,766 | 2705 | ✅ VERIFIED |
| JADES DR4 spectroscopy | 5,190 | 238 | ✅ VERIFIED |
| COSMOS-Web LEPHARE | 784,016 | 4201 | ✅ VERIFIED |
| Labbé+23 reference | 6 | 6 | ✅ VERIFIED |

## Final Catalog Statistics

- **Total unique sources**: 6672
- **Spectroscopic (Gold)**: 214
- **Photometric**: 6458

### By Quality Tier
| Tier | N | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| Gold | 214 | Spectroscopic + published |
| Silver | 3515 | High-quality photometric |
| Bronze | 2943 | Standard photometric |

### By Redshift
| z Range | N |
|---------|---|
| 6.5-8 | 5220 |
| 8-10 | 988 |
| 10-12 | 321 |
| 12-14 | 58 |
| 14+ | 85 |

## Data Quality Validation

### M_UV Coverage
- Sources with M_UV: 2437
- Range: [-24.7, -12.4] mag

### Stellar Mass Coverage
- Sources with log(M*): 4173
- Range: [6.2, 12.6]

### Size (r_eff) Coverage
- Sources with r_eff: 2189
- Range: [0.06, 2.97] kpc

## Output Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| highz_catalog_VERIFIED_v1.csv | Main catalog (6672 sources) |
| highz_spectro_GOLD.csv | Spectroscopic sample only |
| fig1a_uv_luminosity_function.pdf | UV LF by redshift bin |
| fig2a_stellar_mass_function.pdf | SMF by redshift bin |
| fig3a_sfr_distribution.pdf | SFR distributions |
| fig4a_size_mass_relation.pdf | r_eff vs M* |
| fig5a_redshift_distribution.pdf | N(z) comparison |
| table1a_sample_statistics.tex | LaTeX statistics table |

## Contaminated Data Excluded

The following sources were NOT used:
- janus_z_reference_catalog.csv (DELETED - 66% fictitious)
- janus_z_complete.csv (DELETED - derived from contaminated)
- All DONOTUSE_* special samples (preserved for historical reference)

## Validation Against Literature

Expected consistency checks:
- UV LF slope: Should match Harikane+2024, Bouwens+2021
- SMF normalization: Should match Stefanon+2021
- Size-mass slope: Should match Ono+2024

## Conclusion

Phase 3.0.a/3.1.a successfully completed using only verified data.
Ready for Phase 3.2.a (JANUS theoretical predictions).
