### [2512.23157v1] The GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program. V. H$α$ luminosity functions at $z\sim1.3$ and $z\sim2.0$
- **Authors**: Yuxuan Pang, Xin Wang, Tommaso Treu
- **Date**: 2025-12-29
- **arXiv**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23157v1
- **Categories**: astro-ph.GA

> We present H$α$ luminosity function (LF) measurements at redshifts $z\sim1.3$ and $z\sim2.0$ using JWST NIRISS grism data from the GLASS-JWST survey. Based on emission lines spectroscopically identified in the F115W, F150W and F200W filters, we select 99 H$α$ emitters. Through detailed effective vol...

### [2512.20945v1] Mid-IR luminosity functions: inferred dusty cosmic star-formation and black hole accretion histories from the JWST SMILES
- **Authors**: Chih-Teng Ling, Tomotsugu Goto, Seong Jin Kim
- **Date**: 2025-12-24
- **arXiv**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20945v1
- **Categories**: astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO

> Mid-infrared (mid-IR) observations are crucial for understanding galaxy evolution, tracing star formation, and active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity via dust emission. This work presents mid-IR galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) at $0.5 < z < 6$, derived from the JWST Systematic Mid-infrared Instrume...

### [2512.24895v1] Resolving the Origins and Pathways of Ionizing Radiation Escape with UV Integral Field Spectroscopy
- **Authors**: Cody Carr, Renyue Cen, Brian Fleming
- **Date**: 2025-12-31
- **arXiv**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24895v1
- **Categories**: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA

> The Epoch of Reionization marks the last major phase transition in the early Universe, during which the majority of neutral hydrogen once filling the intergalactic medium was ionized by the first galaxies. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable o...

### [2601.00089v1] Little Red Dots: The Assembly of Early Supermassive Black Holes in the JWST Era
- **Authors**: David D Vaida, Ryan Jeffrey Farber
- **Date**: 2025-12-31
- **arXiv**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00089v1
- **Categories**: astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO

> Since the launch of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in late 2021, our understanding of high-redshift objects has faced several upheavals. JWST has discovered much more massive galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBH) than cosmological models had expected. Furthermore, JWST observations have re...

### [2512.21632v1] Can A Kinematically Hot and Thick Disk Form A Bar? : Role of Highly Spinning Dark Matter Halos
- **Authors**: Sandeep Kumar Kataria
- **Date**: 2025-12-25
- **arXiv**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21632v1
- **Categories**: astro-ph.GA

> Recent JWST observations claim the existence of a significant fraction of bars in the kinematically hotter and thicker disk at high redshift Universe. These observations challenge the current understanding of disk stability in galaxies similar to the Milky Way. The analytical work and N-body simulat...
